                <h2>About Stephen</h2>
                <p>
                    Stephen has created a wide range of multimedia for organizations large and small. The first video he produced
                    was for AmeriCorps while serving as a member back in the late 1990's. Since then he has worked for a small video production
                    house, a CBS affiliate, a nationally recognized staged event company, and for almost the last decade has led multimedia
                    production for two of the world's largest offshore drilling companies. During this time, he earned his
                    bachelor's degree in Mass Communications and a master's degree in Journalism.<br><br>
                    Always on the prowl to expand his multimedia skillset, Stephen is now working toward a Senior Web Developer nanodegree from <a href="https://www.udacity.com/"> Udacity</a> (a rigorous program co-created by Google, AT&T, and others).
